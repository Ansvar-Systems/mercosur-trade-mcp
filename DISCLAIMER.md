## No Warranty

This software is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, express or
implied. Ansvar Systems AB assumes no liability for any damages arising from
the use of this tool or the data it provides.

## Data Accuracy

Every effort is made to ensure data accuracy:
- All data is sourced from authoritative treaty repositories (see `sources.yml`)
- Zero AI-generated or summarized content in the database
- Automated golden tests verify data integrity
- Scheduled ingestion keeps data current (see `COVERAGE.md` for refresh schedule)

However, automated ingestion can introduce errors. When precision matters,
cross-reference with the authoritative source.

## Authoritative Sources

See `sources.yml` and `COVERAGE.md` for the complete list of data sources,
their versions, and known limitations.
